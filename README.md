## **Introduction**

In today's highly competitive business environment, retaining valuable customers is as critical as acquiring new ones. Research consistently shows that focusing on customer retention is far more cost-effective than customer acquisition. **Custalyze** provides businesses with the tools to understand customer behaviors, predict future value, and make data-backed decisions that drive profitability.

By using **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** predictions and personalized recommendations, businesses can prioritize high-value customers, reduce churn, and optimize their marketing investments for maximum impact.

## **Problem Statement**

Many businesses lack insight into the long-term value of their customers. This often results in inefficient allocation of marketing resources, wasted budgets, and missed opportunities to engage and retain high-value customers.

Businesses need an effective way to:
- Understand which customers are most valuable.
- Predict future behavior to optimize marketing spend.
- Engage customers with personalized offers that enhance their lifetime value.

## **Solution Overview**

Custalyze offers a comprehensive data-driven solution that helps businesses:
- **Predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Accurately forecast the future worth of each customer to prioritize marketing efforts.
- **Segment Customers**: Divide customers into actionable groups based on RFM scores and CLV predictions.
- **Personalize Engagement**: Develop personalized product recommendations to enhance customer loyalty and increase engagement.
- **Optimize Marketing Spend**: Allocate resources more efficiently by focusing on customers with the highest potential value.

## **Project Workflow**

### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploration**
- Perform  data cleaning and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behaviors and identify trends.
- Cleanse and transform raw data into usable formats for modeling.

### **Step 2: RFM Analysis**
- Conduct **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to evaluate customer engagement and behavior:
  - **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
  - **Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase.
  - **Monetary**: How much a customer spends on average.

### **Step 3: Predict CLV Using Statistical Models**
- **BG/NBD Model**: Predict future purchase probabilities based on customer transaction history.
- **Gamma-Gamma Model**: Estimate the monetary value of future transactions based on past spending patterns.
- Combine these models to forecast each customer's **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**.

### **Step 4: Customer Segmentation**
- Apply **K-Means Clustering** or other machine learning algorithms to group customers based on their predicted CLV and RFM scores.
- Create actionable customer segments, such as:
  - **High-Value Loyal Customers**
  - **At-Risk Customers**
  - **Low-Engagement Customers**
- These segments inform personalized marketing strategies aimed at increasing retention and engagement.

### **Step 5: Build a Personalized Recommendation System**
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend products to customers based on similarities in purchase behavior.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggest products based on the attributes of items customers have interacted with in the past.
- Align recommendations with each customer's predicted CLV and segment to maximize engagement and increase conversion rates.

### **Step 6: Model Deployment Using Streamlit**
- **Streamlit App**: Deploy the CLV prediction model via an interactive **Streamlit** web application.
  - Users can interact with the app to explore customer CLV predictions and segment insights.
  - The web app provides a user-friendly interface for knowing customer value and making data-driven decisions.
